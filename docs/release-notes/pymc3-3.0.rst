After more than `5 years <https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/commit/85c7e06b6771c0d99cbc09cb68885cda8f7785cb>`_ of ongoing development, contributions from over 80 individuals, we are proud and excited to release the first stable version of PyMC3: 3.0.

What is it?
-----------

PyMC3 is a Python module for Bayesian modeling which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational inference algorithms. Models are expressed as intuitive Python code which allows for great flexibility. By relying on Theano as a computational backend, PyMC3 can handle highly complex and large models with thousands of parameters in a performant manner.
