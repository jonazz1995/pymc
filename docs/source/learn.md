:::{grid-item-card} Bayesian Methods for Hackers

By Cameron Davidson-Pilon

<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4a0aca82ca82efab71747d00db30f3a68de98e82/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f36444b596250622e706e673f31">

The "hacker" in the title  means learn-as-you-code. This hands-on introduction teaches intuitive definitions of the Bayesian approach to statistics, worklflow and decision-making by applying them using PyMC.
